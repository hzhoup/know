## Introduction to AI

Artificial Intelligence studies how make computers exhibit intelligent behavior.

Originally, computers were invented to operate on numbers following a well-defined procedure - an algorithm. Modern computers, still follow the same idea of controlled computations. Thus it is possible to program a computer to do something if we know the exact sequence of steps that we need to do in order to achieve the goal.

There are some tasks, however, that we do not explicitly know how to solve. This is exactly the kind of task that are of interest to Artificial Intelligence (AI for short).

### Weak AI vs. Strong AI

The task of solving a specific human-like problem, can be called Weak AI, because we are creating a system for only one task, and not a system that can solve many tasks. A generally intelligent computer system would be called Strong AI or Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

### The Definition of Intelligence and the Turing Test

We cannot properly define Intelligence. When speaking about AGI we need to have some way to tell if we have created a truly intelligent system. Alan Turing proposed a way called a [[202302011345|Turing Test]],
