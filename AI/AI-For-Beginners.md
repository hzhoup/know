## Introduction to AI

Artificial Intelligence studies how make computers exhibit intelligent behavior.

Originally, computers were invented to operate on numbers following a well-defined procedure - an algorithm. Modern computers, still follow the same idea of controlled computations. Thus it is possible to program a computer to do something if we know the exact sequence of steps that we need to do in order to achieve the goal.

There are some tasks, however, that we do not explicitly know how to solve. This is exactly the kind of task that are of interest to Artificial Intelligence (AI for short).
