## Introduction to AI

Artificial Intelligence studies how make computers exhibit intelligent behavior.

Originally, computers were invented to operate on numbers following a well-defined procedure - an algorithm. Modern computers, still follow the same idea of controlled computations. Thus it is possible to program a computer to do something if we know the exact sequence of steps that we need to do in order to achieve the goal.

There are some tasks, however, that we do not explicitly know how to solve. This is exactly the kind of task that are of interest to Artificial Intelligence (AI for short).

### Weak AI vs. Strong AI

The task of solving a specific human-like problem, can be called Weak AI, because we are creating a system for only one task, and not a system that can solve many tasks. A generally intelligent computer system would be called Strong AI or Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

### The Definition of Intelligence and the Turing Test

We cannot properly define Intelligence. When speaking about AGI we need to have some way to tell if we have created a truly intelligent system. Alan Turing proposed a way called a [[202302011345|Turing Test]].

### Different Approaches to AI

If we want a computer to behave like a human, we need somehow to model inside a computer our way of thinking. We need to try to understand what makes a human being intelligent.

There are two possible approaches to this problem:

| Top-down Approach (Symbolic Reasoning)                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Bottom-up Approach (Neural Networks)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| A top-down approach models the way a person reasons to solve a problem. It involves extracting **knowledge** from a human being, and representing it in a computer-readable form. We also need to develop a way to model **reasoning** inside a computer. | A bottom-up approach models the structure of a human brain, consisting of huge number of simple units called **neurons**. Each neuron acts like a weighted average of its inputs, and we can train a network of neurons to solve useful problems by providing **training data**. |

There are also some other possible approaches to intelligence:

- -   An **Emergent**, **Synergetic** or **multi-agent approach** are based on the fact that complex intelligent behaviour can be obtained by an interaction of a large number of simple agents. According to evolutionary cybernetics, intelligence can _emerge_ from more simple, reactive behaviour in the process of _metasystem transition_.
- -   An **Evolutionary approach**, or **genetic algorithm** is an optimization process based on the principles of evolution.
